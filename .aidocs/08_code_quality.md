# Code Quality and Best Practices Assessment

## Adherence to CodeCop/AppSourceCop Rules (Inferred)
- **TextConst Usage:** User-facing messages and errors are defined as labels, supporting localization and best practices.
- **Commit Usage:** No use of `Commit` in loops or event subscribers; all data changes are transactional and safe.
- **Variable Initialization and Scope:** Variables are scoped appropriately, and initialization is clear and explicit.
- **WITH Statement:** No use of `WITH` statements, in line with best practices.
- **SetAutoCalcFields:** Not used, as the extension does not manipulate SIFT fields directly.
- **Naming and Structure:** PascalCase is used for objects, methods, and variables. File and object naming conventions follow Microsoft guidelines.
- **Access Modifiers:** Implementation codeunits use `Access = Internal;`.

## Error Handling
- **Pattern:** Uses `ThrowError()` and user-friendly error messages, often with localized labels.
- **Try Functions:** `[TryFunction]` is used for permission checks and external calls, ensuring robust error handling without crashing the session.
- **User Guidance:** Errors are caught and displayed as helpful messages, with suggestions for next steps or configuration.

## Performance Considerations (Inferred)
- **Result Limits:** All table, field, and data queries are limited (50 tables/fields, 100 records) to prevent performance issues.
- **Efficient Filtering:** Smart filtering and pagination are used to avoid large result sets.
- **No Inefficient SIFT Usage:** No use of `CALCFIELDS` or SIFT in loops.
- **Database Calls:** Record iteration is efficient, with appropriate use of filters and keys.
- **No Locking Issues:** No use of `LOCKTABLE` or long-running transactions.

## Security Considerations (Inferred)
- **Permission Checks:** All data access is validated via `TablePermissionHelper` and Business Central's permission system.
- **Secret Management:** API keys and endpoints are stored as `SecretText` in isolated storage, never as plain text.
- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** All secrets are managed securely.
- **No SQL Injection Risk:** No dynamic query building; all filters are parameterized and safe.
- **API Usage:** All external calls use HTTPS endpoints.

## Testability (Inferred)
- **Separation of Logic:** Business logic is separated from UI logic, supporting unit testing.
- **Test Strategy:** The extension is designed to be tested via the "Data Explorer with Copilot" action, with clear boundaries for function calls and permission checks.
- **No Dedicated Test Codeunits:** No test libraries or test codeunits are present, but the modular design supports future testability.

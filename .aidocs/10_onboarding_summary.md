# Onboarding Summary and Next Steps

## Key Strengths of the Codebase
- **Modular, Function-Based Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns with well-defined modules for orchestration, function logic, helpers, and setup.
- **Security-First Design:** All data access is permission-checked and secrets are managed securely using isolated storage.
- **Extensible and Maintainable:** The AOAI Function interface and registration pattern make it easy to add new capabilities or extend existing ones.

## Areas for Attention/Improvement
- **Potential God Object Risk:** The orchestrator codeunit could become overly complex as new features are added; consider further modularization if it grows.
- **No Automated Tests:** While the design is testable, there are no dedicated test codeunits; adding automated tests would improve reliability.
- **Limited Eventing/Extensibility:** The extension relies on direct function calls; consider adding events or interfaces for more flexible extensibility in the future.

## Recommended First Steps for a New Developer
1. **Review the Architecture and Key Flows:** Start with `03_architecture.md` and `05_key_flows.md` to understand the system's structure and main business process.
2. **Explore the AOAI Function Implementations:** Study the codeunits in `src/Functions/` to see how table, field, and data discovery are implemented.
3. **Understand Security and Setup:** Review `DataExplorerSecretMgt.Codeunit.al` and `DataExplorerSetup.Table.al` to learn how configuration and secret management work.
